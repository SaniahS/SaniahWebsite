    <h3>By growing things that are in season.
We should shift our focus to local, seasonal, and sustainable foods whenever possible. 
We shop at the farmer’s market. 
We use our local food producers, food growers regionally and 
We make every effort to prepare things from scratch. This way we know what goes into the food we produce.
When we don’t source from 
out of county or very long distances 
then we’re saving a lot of fuel petroleum and the carbon footprint is minimized when we source like that.
