<h2>A raster image</h2>
    <img src="images/Saniah_Selfie600px.jpg" alt="My artistic selfie" width="600px"/>
    <p>I created this image in Photoshop from my original selfie and I added a background photo of a sky that I took when I traveled to Georgia. I used an original selfie photo taken saved in my MMP folder. I created layers and masks. I changed the background color. I chose clouds and what I remember when travelling to the beach. I modified the image to my liking and saved it. I worked in Bracket and Sublime. I modified the code in stlyes.css and gallery.html to my liking. Itook a while, but I enjoyed learinig code and the different techniques that I learned in Adobe Photoshop. </p>

    <p>I created this image in Illustrator by creating many layers and mask. I took an origianal picture from the a selfie photo saved in my files on my computer under MMP 100 folder I created for this class to add to my website. I chose the color green, red, and yellow inspired by the Ethiopian  flag and Bob Marley. My favorite color palette, since childhood was from a flag, the rasta colors. After that I filled in the colors in the shapes that I created. I then saved the image from the layer that I liked and added it to the html structure in the process. I first downloaded Sublime and Bracket to start typing with. I used Siblime first and finished with Bracket.  </p>

<h2>My Audio Project</h2>
<audio controls>
<source src="Saniah_audio_story.mp3" >
</audio>
  <p>This audio story is about sounds that tell a story about my birthday present I created by audio recording. I used Audacity to use my audio recording on my laptop. I downloaded and installed Audacity and created an account to freesound.com as a reference. I used some sounds from Freedsound like "alarm" "brushing teeth" and "knocking door." I uploaded the files from Freedsound into Audacity and changed the name to go with my story. I was able to use the tools like Select, Tracks, Effects, to organize the sound. I layered each sound in order from my sounds in the story. I used Effects, Pitch and Tempo, then Change Pitch to my voice recording in “asking mom.” After that chose Select all to begin to listen to it from the beginning to make sure that it wasn’t too long or too short. From there I would choose Track and click on the Add button if I wanted to add more to the story. I enjoyed using different techniques and methods that I learned outside of class to help create this project in my folder.</p>
