<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am an artist who enjoys the sounds of reggae influenced by musicians Bob Marley, The Wailers, and Rihanna. I enjoy Drawing with charcoal, and will adventure into oil painting and watercolor. I like sports like basketball, and flag football. I frequently travel to Charleston, SC, and Hilton head SC for the beach's to take photos there. My hobbies are looking for new restaurants that specialize in salad. I want to develop a videogame/comic book art style. Also do voiceovers and voice acting. </p>
